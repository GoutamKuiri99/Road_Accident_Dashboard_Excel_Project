### Project Overview
Developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze road accident data, tracking key indicators like fatal, serious, and slight casualties. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of accident trends across vehicle types, road conditions, and locations.

### Problem Statement
🎯 Client: We want to identify accident patterns, high-risk conditions, and overall casualty distribution to improve road safety measures and resource allocation.

### KPIs & Metrics Analyzed

- Total Casualties: 417,883

- Fatal Casualties: 7,135

- Serious Casualties: 59,312

- Slight Casualties: 3,514

- Vehicle Type Casualties (Cars: 333k+, Bikes: 33k+, Others)

- Casualties by Road Surface (Dry, Wet, Snow/Ice)

- Casualties by Location (Urban 61%, Rural 39%)

- Casualties by Time (Daylight 73%, Dark 27%)

### Visualization Highlights

### Conclusion
The dashboard revealed that most accidents occur on single carriageways, predominantly in urban areas, and largely during daylight. Car users account for the majority of casualties. These insights can guide authorities to implement targeted road safety policies, improve infrastructure, and run awareness campaigns in high-risk zones.
